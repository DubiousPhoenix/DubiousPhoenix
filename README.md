👋🏿 Heya 

🕹️ I'm Phoenix, most of my time is spent making, playing, and thinking about vidja games. I'm also a massive egomaniac.

My languages of choice are

⚛️ React

🐍 Python

I dabble in other languages, but when making anything bigger than a 30 line script, I prefer to use these over everything else.

📋 As a game dev I'm also familiar with software like Unreal Engine, Aesprite, Substance (Design and Paint), most of the Adobe Suite, NOT ZBRUSH, and Autodesk Maya. 

I've done 

🎮 Game Design

🎭 Narrative Design

🌳Enviromental Design

🤸‍♂️ Animation

📃Technical Artistry

in my career so hit me up if you need help understanding why you suck ass at using the insert edge loop tool or why your nsfw animation looks like a kid rubbing 2 barbies up against one another. While, I won't give you my REAL LIFE portfolio just know I'm not a rockstar. I didn't wake up with talent and pollute ArtStation with masterpieces. I've never worked above AA studios and indies.

🔥 I don't beat around the bush

:neckbeard: I'm not a fucking elitist

🧠 I'm not autistic

So have no fear. I'm not going to spaz if you actually dm me looking for advice.
