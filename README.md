Heya :wave: 

I'm Phoenix, most of my time is spent making, playing, and thinking about vidja games. I'm also part artist, part influencer, and part egomaniac.

✨My languages of choice are
React
&
Python

I dabble in other languages, but when making anything bigger than a 30 line script, I prefer to use these over everything else.

As a game dev I'm also familiar with software like Unreal Engine, Substance (Design and Paint), most of the Adobe Suite, NOT ZBRUSH, and Autodesk Maya. I've done Game Design, Narrative Design, Enviromental Design, Animation and Technical Artistry in my career so hit me up if you need help understanding why you suck ass at using the insert edge loop tool or why your nsfw animation looks like a kid rubbing 2 barbies up against one another.

I don't beat around the bush, I'm not a fucking code elitist and I'm not autistic. So have no fear. I'm not going to spaz if you actually dm me looking for advice.
